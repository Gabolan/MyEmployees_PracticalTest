Practical Exercise 

Backend position:
API to search, add and remove employees records. Just use fullname, birth and id. One endpoint to search the employee by name (contains) and return a list of employees, an endpoint to add a new employee and an endpoint to remove an employee. Use mock data
Tips:
1. Organize the code correctly as you usually do to have clear architecture app (code and files)
2. In the backend side use mock data (with 3-4 records)
3. Add some unit tests (2 would be good) on top of the developed code
